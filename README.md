# Tic_Tac_Toe
This is a simple Java implementation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe. 

This is a simple Java implementation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 board, and the players take turns marking spaces with 'X' or 'O' until one of the players gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 

The game board is represented using a two-dimensional array, and the user interface is implemented using the command line. The program prompts the user for the row and column of the cell they want to mark and checks whether the move is valid before making it.

The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full (i.e., a tie game). The project is a good starting point for beginners who want to learn how to implement simple games in Java.
